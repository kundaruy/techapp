Output:

The output of this code is a To-Do application interface rendered using React Native components. Here's a breakdown of the output:

Header Section:
At the top, there's a header section with a green-colored "To Do Application" title.
Below the title, there are three input fields for adding tasks: one for the task name, one for the priority, and one for additional details.
Add Task Button:
Below the input fields, there's a button labeled "Add Task" or "Update Task" based on whether a task is being added or edited respectively. This button is green-colored.
Task List:
Beneath the input fields and the button, there's a list of tasks displayed using a FlatList.
Each task item in the list includes:
A checkbox on the left side indicating the completion status of the task.
The task name in bold font.
The priority of the task in blue font.
Additional details of the task.
"Edit" and "Delete" buttons on the right side of each task item.
Clear Completed Button:
At the bottom, there's a red-colored button labeled "Clear Completed" for removing completed tasks from the list.
Modal:
When the "Edit" button of a task is clicked, a modal pops up.
The modal contains an input field to edit the task name and two buttons labeled "Save" and "Cancel".
The interface provides functionality to add new tasks, edit existing tasks, mark tasks as completed/uncompleted by toggling checkboxes, delete tasks, and clear completed tasks from the list. The UI is styled with appropriate colors, fonts, and spacing to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

Code:
Imports: The code imports necessary components from the React Native library such as React, useState, and UI components like View, Text, TextInput, TouchableOpacity, FlatList, StyleSheet, and Modal.
Functional Component Declaration: The code defines a functional component named App.
State Variables: Inside the App component, several state variables are declared using the useState hook. These variables manage the task input (task), priority input (priority), details input (details), the list of tasks (tasks), the index of the task being edited (editIndex), whether the modal is visible or not (modalVisible), and the index of the selected task (selectedTaskIndex).
Event Handlers: The component defines various event handlers such as handleAddTask, handleEditTask, handleDeleteTask, handleToggleTask, and handleClearCompleted to manage adding, editing, deleting, toggling completion, and clearing completed tasks respectively.
Render Item Function: The renderItem function is defined to render individual tasks within the FlatList.
Return Statement: In the return statement, the component returns JSX code representing the UI layout of the application. It includes a header section with input fields for task, priority, and details, a button to add or update a task, a list of tasks rendered using FlatList, a button to clear completed tasks, and a modal for editing tasks.
Styles: The code includes a styles object containing CSS-like styles for various UI elements like container, header, input fields, buttons, tasks, checkboxes, modal, etc.
Export: Finally, the App component is exported as the default export of the module.
This code creates a simple To-Do application with features like adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.
